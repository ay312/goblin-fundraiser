	<!-- Section 1 -->
	<h3> Why save the goblins? </h3>
	
	<p> Life as a goblin is <em>not something we tend to think about</em>      		in modern society.</p>
	<p><strong> But the goblins do </strong>.... In fact they live it everyday</p>

	<p> <em> The World Health Organisation has <strong> not officially        </strong> classified gold addiction as a serious mental disorder after the 2019 health panel held in Argentina.</em></p>
	<p> The question we should now ask is <strong> why should this be a problem? </strong> </p>

	<!-- Section 2 -->
	<h3> Gold, Gold and Gold</h3>

	<p> The impact of this huge love for gold has caused the goblins to hoard excessively, which initially was encouraged in our society due to the opening of banks and financial support given to public services - alchemy and meditation centres to support research to advance the technological age of the society. </p>

	<p> For example, in the last 80 years, taming of giants for use in
	agriculture and warfare has been an advancement that was seemingly before impossible </p>

	<p> This caused the goblins to be praised endlessly - yet with all praise - it should be taken with a <em>pinch of salt </em> </p>

	<p> Due to the limited capacity of goblins to see the picture hollistically, the praise went beyond the goblins head and fast-track to today (2045) goblins suffer from near-extinction due to civil wars, addiction to gold to the point where goblins become violent and self-destructive and goblins on the brink of mass-starvation due to not purchasing food ( <em> preferring to eat each other due to it being free  </em>).</p>
